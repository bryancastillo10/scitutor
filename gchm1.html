	<h3><a name="intro">Introduction to General Chemistry</a></h3>

 	<p>Chemistry is the study of matter and the chemical reactions between the substances. Matter is defined as anything that occupies
 	space and has mass. To further understand chemistry, here are basic terminologies:</p>

 	<ul>
 	<li><strong>Atom</strong>- indivisible particles that were hypothesized by Democritus to comprise in order to form an element.
 	<br>Also known as the building blocks of matter. An atom is generally composed of smaller particles namely proton, electron, and neutron.
 <li><strong>Proton</strong>- positively charged particles that is located in the nucleus of an atom</li>
 <li><strong>Electron</strong>- negatively charged particles that is outside the nucleus of an atom</li>
 <li><strong>Neutron</strong>- neutral particles that is associated with proton in the nucleus of an atom</li>
 <li><strong>Nucleon</strong>- collective term for protons and neutron</li>
 <li><strong>Element</strong>- a substance that cannot be broken down by simple chemical changes</li>
 <li><strong>Compound</strong>- the substance formed when two or more elements are chemically bonded together</li>
 <li><strong>Mixture</strong>- the combination of two or more substance without any chemical means, no chemical reactions take place with their formation</li>
 <li><strong>Homogeneous Mixture</strong>- a component of solid, liquid, and gaseous mixture that has the same proportions of each components</li>
 <li><strong>Heterogeneous Mixture</strong>- the opposite of homogeneous mixture by which its components vary in proportions</li>
 	</ul>

<section id="main">
	<h3><a name="state">States of Matter</a></h3>
		<p>There are three fundamental states of matter namely, <strong>solid, liquid, and gas</strong>. These states generally differs on the distances between the molecules in order to occupy its space.
		In a solid, molecules are held close together in an orderly fashion with little freedom of motion. Molecules in a liquid are close together but are not held so
	rigidly in position and can move past one another. In a gas, the molecules are separated by distances that are large compared with the size of the molecules.
	The three states of matter can be interconverted without changing the composition of the substance. This process is called phase change. For example, ice turns into liquid water by melting.
	It can be expressed as: H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>&#40s&#41</sub>&#8652H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>&#40l&#41</sub>.</p>

	<h3><a name="property">Properties of Matter</a></h3>
		<p>Matters have classifications depending on its properties. There are physical properties that could either be observed or tasted. It can
		be subclassified dependinf on the amount dependence of the substance. Another classification is the its chemical properties which describes the
		property of a substance to undergo chemical reaction forming a new substance.<p>
		<ul>
		<li><strong>Extensive Property</strong>- quantity dependent property, the value of these properties changes with respect to the amount of matter/substance</li>
		   <p class="example">Examples: Volume, Mass, Size, Weight, Length</p>
		<li><strong>Intensive Property</strong>- quantity independent property, the value of these properties does not change with respect to the amount of matter of matter/substance</li>
		 <p class="example">Examples: Boiling Point, Temperature, Color, Luster,Hardness</p>
		<li><strong>Chemical Property</strong>- property that is exhibited by matter as it undergoes changes in composition or chemical reactions</li>
		<p class="example">Examples: Flammability, Reactivity, Oxidation States, Enthalpy</p>
		</ul><br>

		<p class="caption" > An ice that melts is an intensive property. The color of the zinc oxide which is white is an extensive property. The flammability
	of gasoline as it burns through combustion reaction is a chemical property.</p>

	<h3><a name="history">Brief History of Atom Discovery</a></h3>
	<p>An atom is generally composed of protons,electrons, and neutrons by which were discovered by different scientists with their respective experiments.
	In the early fifth century, the Greek philosopher Democritus expressed his belief that all matter consists of very small, indivisible particles by which he called <strong>atomos</strong> (meaning
uncuttable or indivisible). At some point, Democritus’ idea was not  generally accepted by many people. Until experimental evidences from early scientific investigations provided support for that belief and gradually gave
rise to the modern definitions of elements and compounds. An English scientist, John Dalton, established hypotheses about the nature of atoms that gave also birth to the modern era of chemistry. The following are Dalton's
atomic theory:</p>
<ol>
<li>Elements are composed of extremely small particles called atoms.</li>
<li>All atoms of a given element are identical, having the same size, mass, and
chemical properties. The atoms of one element are different from the atoms of
all other elements.</li>
<li>Compounds are composed of atoms of more than one element. In any compound,
the ratio of the numbers of atoms of any two of the elements present is either an
integer or a simple fraction.</li>
<li>A chemical reaction involves only the separation, combination, or rearrangement
of atoms; it does not result in their creation or destruction.</li>
</ol>
<p>Through that theories derived by Dalton, we can now define atom as the basic unit of an element that can enter into chemical combination. A series of
researches were followed regarding the sub-atomic particles involved in the composition of an atom. A brief summary is shown below:</p>

<h3><a name="chemobs">Fundamental Chemical Observations</a></h3>
	<p>The idea of Dalton's theories on the nature of atom also gaves rise to the laws that clearly describes the behavior of an atom with its interaction
	to other atoms. Those laws are the <strong>law of definite proportions</strong> established by Joseph Proust, a French chemist; the <strong>law of multiple proportions</strong>; and the <strong>law of conservation
	of mass</strong>. These laws strongly supports the hypotheses of John Dalton.</p>
  <ul>
	<li><strong>Law of Definite Proportions</strong>-states that different samples of the same compound always contain its constituent elements in the same proportion by mass.
For example,if we were to analyze samples of carbon dioxide gas obtained from different sources, we would find in each sample the same ratio by mass of carbon to oxygen.</li>
	<li><strong>Law of Multiple Proportions</strong>-states that if two elements can combine to form more than one compound, the masses of one element that combine with a fi xed mass of the other
element are in ratios of small whole numbers. For example, carbon forms two stable compounds with oxygen, namely, carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide. This best explains the principle of balancing chemical equations. </li>
	<li><strong>Law of Conservation of Mass</strong>-states that matter can be neither created nor destroyed. It is because matter is made of atoms that are unchanged in a chemical reaction, it follows that mass must be conserved as well. This principle is mainly used by chemical engineers to design chemical processes in a large scale.</li>
  </ul>
	<h3><a name="period">The Periodic Table of Elements</a></h3>
	<p>Throughout the discovery of elements and their chemical properties, recognition of periodic regularities in physical and chemical
	behavior are in need to organize the large volume of available information. It led to the development of the <strong>periodic table of elements</strong>, a chart in which elements having similar chemical and physical
	properties are grouped together. It was first proposed by Dmitri Mendeleev, a Russian chemist last 1869.</p>

	<p><img class="periodic" src="./imggchm/Periodic Table.png" height="500"/></p>
	<p class="caption" style="text-align:center;"><strong>The Periodic Table of Elements</strong></p>
	<p>In this table, vertical rows are called groups or families while horizontal rows are called periods. There are 118 elements that were either discovered naturally occuring or synthetic &#40They are formed through laboratory experiments&#41.
	Elements can be divided into three categories which are metals, nonmetals, and metalloids.
	A <strong>metal</strong> is a good conductor of heat and electricity while a <strong>nonmetal</strong> is
	usually a poor conductor of heat and electricity. Meanwhile, a <strong>metalloid</strong> has properties that are intermediate between those of metals and nonmetals.
	To summarize the families and series in the periodic table, here are the list: </p>
	<ul>
<li><strong>Alkali Metals &#40Group IA&#41</strong>- first group of metals (ns<sup>1</sup> elements), H, Li, Na, …</li>
<li><strong>Alkaline Earth Metals &#40Group IIA&#41</strong>- second group of metals (ns<sup>2</sup> elements), Be, Mg, Ca, …</li>
<li><strong>Boron Group &#40Group IIIA&#41</strong>- first group of non-metals (ns<sup>2</sup>p<sup>1</sup> elements), B, Al, Ga, …</li>
<li><strong>Carbon Group &#40GroupIVA&#41</strong>- second group of non-metals (ns<sup>2</sup>p<sup>2</sup> elements), C, Si, Ge, …</li>
<li><strong>Pnictogens or Nitrogen Group &#40Group VA&#41</strong>- third group of non-metals (ns<sup>2</sup>p<sup>3</sup> elements), N, P, As, …</li>
<li><strong>Chalcogens or Oxygen Group &#40Group VIA&#41</strong>- fourth group of non-metals (ns<sup>2</sup>p<sup>4</sup> elements), O, S, Se, …</li>
<li><strong>Halogens or Salt-former Group &#40Group VIIA&#41</strong>- fifth group of non-metals, known to form salts in chemical reactions with 7 electrons in outer shell (ns<sup>2</sup>p<sup>5</sup>), F, Cl, Br, …</li>
<li><strong>Noble Gases &#40Group VIIIA&#41</strong>- most stable group of elements as they follow the octet rule in number of valence electrons (ns<sup>2</sup>p<sup>6</sup>), He, Ne, Ar, …</li>
<li><strong>Early Transition Metals (Groups IIIB to VIIB)</strong>- metals that has valence electrons from d<sup>1</sup> to d<sup>5</sup>, Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, …</li>
<li><strong>Late Transition Metals (Groups VIIIB to XIIB)</strong>- metals that has valence electrons from d<sup>6</sup> to d<sup>10</sup>, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, …</li>
<li><strong>Synthetic Elements</strong>- these elements are artificially made and includes the Lanthanide series (La, Ce, Pr, …) and the Actinide Series (Ac, Th, Pa, …), f-block elements</li></ul>

 <h3><a name="nota">Notation on Elements</a></h3>
  <p>All atoms can be identified by the number of protons and neutrons they contain. The
 <strong>atomic number (Z)</strong> is the number of protons in the nucleus of each atom of an element.
 In a neutral atom the number of protons is equal to the number of electrons, so the atomic number also indicates the number of electrons present in the atom. The
 chemical identity of an atom can be determined solely from its atomic number. Meanwhile, the <strong>mass number (A)</strong> is the total number of neutrons and protons present in the
 nucleus of an atom of an element. It has exception for the most common form of hydrogen, which has one proton and no neutrons. The <strong>number of neutrons</strong> in an atom is equal to the difference between the mass number
 and the atomic number, or <strong>A minus Z</strong>.</p>

<h3><a name="molecules">Molecules and Chemical Formula</a></h3>
 <p>A molecule is an aggregate of at least two atoms in a definite arrangement held together by chemical forces (also called chemical bonds ).
 A molecule may contain atoms of the same element or atoms of two or more elements joined in a fixed ratio as stated by the law of definite proportions.
 Molecules are commonly expressed through chemical formula that allows to show the compositions in terms of the chemical symbols. Chemical formula can be
 categorized into two: molecular formula and empirical formula.</p>
</section>
<div id="content3">
	<ol>
	<li><strong>Molecular Formula</strong> shows the actual number of atoms of each element in the smallest unit of a substance.</li>
	<li><strong>Empirical Formula</strong> tells us which elements are present and the simplest whole-number ratio of their atoms. However, it does not necessarily the actual
	number of atoms in a given molecule.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>An effective way to represent molecules or compounds are through molecular models and chemical formula. As of now, there are over 20 million known chemical compounds that
	results for chemists to establish a nomenclature or rules in naming chemical compounds. It greatly depends on the structure and how the bonds of each elements involved in the compound were bonded.
	Further discussion on types of bonding and molecular bonding theories are discussed on <a href="/inorg.html">inorganic chemistry section</a>.With discussion on naming chemical compounds, here are some
	examples of compounds with their chemical formula and name.</p>
