	<h3><a name="acidbase">Acids and Bases</a></h3>
	<p>A special type of chemical reaction occurs whenever there are pairs of acids and base. They are known to be
	classification of chemicals or substances through the pH scale. Acids and bases can be defined with three
	different theories which are the Arrhenius theory, Bronsted-Lowry theory, and Lewis theory. They have different definitions on an acid and a base
	but they still reflect the same chemical reaction occured and the reacting species of the acids and bases. To further understand an acid and a base, here is a hypothetical
	reaction between an acid and base with its parts:</p>
	<div class="equation"><span style="color:red">HX</span> + <span style="color:blue">H<sub>2</sub>O </span> &#8652
		<span style="color:purple">H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup></span> + <span style="color:green">X<sup>-</sup></span></div>
		<p>In this representation: <span style="color:red">HX is the acid</span>, <span style="color:blue">H<sub>2</sub>O is the base</span>, <span style="color:purple">H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup> is the conjugate acid</span>,
and <span style="color:green">X<sup>-</sup> is the conjugate base</span>. In addition, a proton of the acid can either be represnted by H<sup>+</sup> or H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup>.</p>
<p>Acids and bases were also categorized depending on strengths on how acidic or how basic they could be. This can be identified through the scale called <strong>pH</strong>. However,
there are times the value of pH is not given. There is still a way to determine the strength of acids and bases. They can be described as follows:</p>
<ul>
 <li><strong>Strong Acid</strong>- all acid halides are considered to be strong acids except for HF (due to the hydrogen bonding). These includes
 HCl, HBr, and HI. Other strong acids include nitric acid(HNO<sub>3</sub>), sulfuric acid (H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>),
 and perchloric acid (HClO<sub>4</sub>).</li></ul>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Weak Acid</strong>- almost organic acids are considered to be weak acids such as acetic acid (CH<sub>3</sub>COOH) and formic acid (CHCOOH). Other weak acids
	  are phosphoric acid (H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>) and hydrogen sulfide (H<sub>2</sub>S)</li>
	  <li><strong>Strong Bases</strong>-almost strong bases are those who has hydroxides (OH<sup>-</sup>) as their component. Some strong bases include sodium
	  hydroxide (NaOH), potassium hydroxide (KOH), and calcium hydroxide Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub></li>
	  <li><strong>Weak Bases</strong>-almost organic bases like pyridine (C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>5</sub>N) and trimethylamine (CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>N and
	  also ionic bases such as HS<sup>-</sup> and HCOO<sup>-</sup>. Another weak base is ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>)</li>
	  </ul>

		<h3><a name="phscale">The pH Scale</a></h3>
		  <p>Whenever discussing about acids and bases, the parameter pH measures the acidity or alkalinity (basicity) of a substance. The pH scale has a value ranging from 0 to 14 wherein 7
		  is the midpoint that represents the neutral condition. If pH approaches the ranges below 7, the substance is acidic while if the pH is from 7 above up to 14, the substance is basic.
		  pH can be represented mathematically as the negative logarithm of H<sup>+</sup> ions (p-function of H<sup>+</sup> ions):</p>
		  <div class="equation">pH = &#8722log[H<sup>+</sup>] &nbsp or &nbsp [H<sup>+</sup>] = 10<sup>&#8722pH</sup></div>
		  <div class="centerme"><img src="./imggchm/pH.jpg" width="700" height="120"/></div>
		  <p>Water(H<sub>2</sub>O) is a special molecule with regards to pH because it has the property of being <strong>ampotheric</strong>. This property is defined
		  as water could either act as an acid or base with its interaction with other molecules. Ampotherism is greatly depends on the oxidation states of the oxides
		  available in a molecule. Another thing is that, pH is a very important factor for determining quality of the water. Theoretically, water at absolute condition has a pH of 7 (neutral condition). However, pH changes relatively
		  due to the chemical constituents involved or its temperature. Usually, at lower temperature,
		  the pH rises up (pH &gt 7) approaching basic condition while at higher temperature, pH of water becomes acidic (pH &lt 7). As stated there are also
		  chemical constituents that makes water changes its pH. In depth discussion on acid-base reactions are further discussed on
		  <a href="anachm1.html">analytical chemistry section</a>.</p>
			<p>Another notation that can be expressed in acid-base reactions is the pOH scale. This scale is the p-function of hydroxide (OH<sup>-</sup>) ions
which is also related to the pH scale. It is similar to pH but this time it focuses on the hydroxide concentration:</p>
<div class="equation">pOH &nbsp = &nbsp &#8722log[OH<sup>&#8722</sup>] &nbsp or &nbsp  [OH<sup>&#8722</sup>] = 10<sup>&#8722pOH</sup></div>
<p>The relationship between pH and pOH at room temperature is:</p>
<div class="equation">pH &nbsp + &nbsp pOH &nbsp = &nbsp <strong>14</strong></div>
<h3><a name="equilibria">Introduction to Chemical Equilibrium</a></h3>
<p>In some chemical reactions, there is a state by which both the reactants and products have no further susceptibility to changes as each of the
concentrations of reactants and products remain constant at any time. This concept of balanced forward and reverse reaction is called <strong>chemical equilibrium</strong>.
 A chemical reaction at equilibrium state has always arrow representation of &#8652 which indicates the reaction could either proceed in a forward or reverse direction
 in order to conserve the equal concentrations of reactants and products. Chemical equlibrium is further supported by <strong>Le Chatelier's Principle</strong> by which
it states that if an external stress is applied to a system at equilibrium, the system adjusts in such a way that the stress is partially offset as it tries to re-establish equilibrium..
Consider the hypothetical reaction:</p>
<div class="equation">A + 2B &#8652 AB<sub>2</sub></div>
<p>To correlate the concentrations of each reactants and product, the term <strong>equilibrium constant</strong> (K<sub>c</sub>)is expressed. The expression K<sub>c</sub>
is always represented by the ratio of the concentrations at reverse rate over the concentrations at forward rate of the reaction. It is illustrated as (based from the given hypothetical reaction):</p>
<div class="frac"><div class="maineq">K<sub>c</sub> = </div><span class="Fraction"><span class="Numerator">[AB<sub>2</sub>]</span>
<span class="Denominator">[A][B]<sup>2</sup></span></span></div>

<p> The numerator represents the product while the denominator represents the reactants. It also shows that coefficients involved in the chemical reaction
affects the concentration of the specific component with coefficient exponentially. Concentration should be raised to 2 as expressed. Equilibrium expressions
is also dependent to which phases are involved in the chemical reaction. There are two general classifications of chemical equilibrium which are homogenous equilibrium and heterogeneous equilibrium. <strong>Homogeneous equilibrium</strong> applies to reactions in which all
reacting species are in the same phase. Meanwhile, <strong>heterogeneous equilibrium</strong> is for reactions involving reactants and products at different phases. To be familiarized
with equilibrium expressions, there are general rules in writing the proper equilibrium constant expressions.</p>

<div id="content3">
	<h4>Writing Equilibrium Constant Expressions</h4>
		<ol>
		<li>The concentrations of the reacting species in a chemical equilibrium can be expressed as:</li>
		<ul><li class="indent">For condensed phase: moles per Liter (M) </li><li class="indent">For gaseous phase: moles per Liter (M) or by pressure (usually in atm or mmHg	)</li></ul>
		<li>Pure solids and liquids (heterogeneous equilibria) and solvents (homogeneous equilibria) do not appear in the equilibrium constant expression</li>Example:<br>
		<div class="equation">CaCO<sub>3(s)</sub> &#8652 CaO<sub>3(s)</sub> + CO<sub>2(g)</sub></div>
		<p>The partial equilibrium expression is:</p>
		<p class="equation"><div class="frac"><div class="maineq">K'<sub>c</sub> = </div><span class="Fraction"><span class="Numerator">[CaO][CO<sub>2</sub>]</span>
	<span class="Denominator">[CaCO<sub>3</sub>]</span></span>which should be simplified to:</div></p>
		<div class="equation"><strong>K<sub>c</sub>= [CO<sub>2</sub>]</strong></div>
		<li class="example">Equilibrium constant (K<sub>p</sub> or K<sub>c</sub>) is dimensionless</li>
		<li class="example">Specify the balanced chemical equation and the temperature in quoting a value for the equilibrium constant. The value of equilibrium constant of a reaction
		changes with respect to temperature that is why it is important to add temperature on the details.</li><br>
		</ol>

</div>
<div id="content4">
	<div class="centerme"><img src="./imggchm/seesaw.jpeg" width="300" /></div>
	<div class="caption">Le Chatelier's principle is analogous to the mechanism of a seesaw. Whenever there is an applied weight (representing the chemical stress) to it,
	the balance gets interrupted. Adjustments must be done to maintain balance (condition of chemical equilibrium) and through that principle, certain steps are to be
	applied in order to bring back its balance.</div>
</div>
<div id="pageop">
	<h3><a name="Keq">The Form of K in Chemical Equilibrium</a></h3>
	<p>For gaseous phase reactions, the form of K is proportional to the pressures exerted by the reacting species. It is represented by K<sub>p</sub> by which you can correlate it to the
	equilibrium constant in terms of molar concentration, K<sub>c</sub>. It is mathematically represented as shown below where R is the gas constant (0.0821 L &middot atm/mol &middot K)
	, T is the absolute temperature (units in K), and &#916n which is the change in moles (moles of products minus moles of reactants of condensed and gaseous phases only): </p>
	<div class="equation">K<sub>p</sub>=K<sub>c</sub>(RT)<sup>&#916n</sup></div>

	<p>Another scenario for the equilibrium constant if the whole sequence of chemical equation is change (either the reactants and products were swapped or balancing
	the chemical equation with different sequence of coefficients). Each of these has guidelines to follow:</p>
	<ul>
	<li><strong>Case 1</strong>: When the equation for a reversible reaction is written in the opposite direction, the K<sub>c</sub> becomes the
	<strong>reciprocal</strong> of the original equilibrium constant</li>
<p>Example:</p>
<div class="equation">N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4(g)</sub> &#8652 2NO<sub>2(g)</sub> at 25°C, K<sub>c</sub>= 4.63 x 10<sup>-3</sup></div>

	<p class="equation"><div class="frac"><div class="maineq">K<sub>c</sub> = </div><span class="Fraction"><span class="Numerator">[NO<sub>2</sub>]<sup>2</sup></span>
	<span class="Denominator">[N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>]</span></span>=  4.63 x 10<sup>-3</sup></div></p>
	<p>When the chemical reaction is reversed,</p>
	<div class="equation">2NO<sub>2(g)</sub> &#8652 N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4(g)</sub> at 25°C, K'<sub>c</sub></div>
	<p class="equation"><div class="frac"><div class="maineq">K'<sub>c</sub> = </div><span class="Fraction"><span class="Numerator">1</span>
	<span class="Denominator">4.63 x 10<sup>-3</sup></span></span>= <strong>216</strong></div></p>
	<li><strong>Case 2</strong>:The value of K also depends on how the equilibrium equation is <strong>balanced</strong>.</li>
	<p>Example:</p>
	<div class="equation">N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4(g)</sub> &#8652 2NO<sub>2(g)</sub> at 25°C, K<sub>c</sub>= 4.63 x 10<sup>-3</sup></div>
	<p>When the coefficient is changed,</p>
	<p class="equation"><div class="frac"><span class="Fraction"><span class="Numerator">1</span>
	<span class="Denominator">2</span></span>N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> &#8652 NO<sub>2</sub> &nbsp at 25°C, K'<sub>c</sub></div></p>
	<div class="equation">K'<sub>c</sub>= &#8730 (K<sub>c</sub>)= &#8730 (4.63 x 10<sup>-3</sup>)= <strong>0.0680</strong></div>

	<p>Another quantity that can be obtained from chemical equilibrium is the <strong>reaction quotient (Q<sub>c</sub>)</strong>. It is obtained by substituting
the initial concentrations into the equilibrium constant expression instead of the original equilibrium concentrations. This value is an effective determinant
to predict which side of the reaction is favorable through their comparison with the equilibrium constants.</p>

<h3><a name="calculate">Calculations Involved in Chemical Equilibrium</a></h3>
<p>There are cases that chemical equilibrium were interfered by a chemical stress, it results to the concentration of the reacting species to change. A known way to identify the equilibrium concentrations
and analyze the chemical equilibrium to such stress is through the ICE table method. It is a modified and convenient method based on the principle of chemical equilibrium of charge and mass balance (on analytical chemistry)
by which equilibrium expressions were derived. In the ICE table, I stands for initial concentration, C stands for the change in the concentration (the chemical stress), and E stands for
equilibrium concentration. To use this table, you will construct a table where the initials of ICE as the rows while each of the reacting species as the columns of the table.
Calculations with this techique is also applicable to acid-base equilibria. Consider again the hypothetical reaction for the equilibrium:</p>
<div class="equation">A + 2B &#8652 AB<sub>2</sub></div>
<table class="icetable">
	<tr>
	<th style="text-align:center;">Chemical Equation:</th>
	<th>A  +</th>
	<th>2B &#8652</th>
	<th> AB<sub>2</sub></th>

	</tr>

<tr>
    <td style="text-align:center;"><strong>I</strong></td>
    <td>A</td>
    <td>B</td>
	<td>AB<sub>2</sub></td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td style="text-align:center;"><strong>C</strong></td>
    <td>-x</td>
    <td>-2x</td>
	<td>+x</td>
  </tr>

    </tr>
  <tr>
    <td style="text-align:center;"><strong>E</strong></td>
    <td>A-x</td>
    <td>B-2x</td>
	<td>AB<sub>2</sub>+ x</td>
  </tr>
	</table>
	<p>Analyzing the table, you can observe that the row I shows the initial concentration which is the reacting species as is. On the other hand, through the change x
(represented by row C), chemical stress was applied in terms of concentration change. The change greatly depends on the coefficient of the reacting species. Additionally,
the portion on the reactants relatively show a negative sign which means it is being consumed while the product side is positive showing it is being generated throughout the change.
Adding the components of each columns on rows I and C results to the formulation of the expressions in row E. Row E represents the equilibrium concentration, thus the resulting equilibrium expression is:</p>
<div class="frac"><div class="maineq">K<sub>c</sub> = </div><span class="Fraction"><span class="Numerator">[AB<sub>2</sub>+x]</span>
<span class="Denominator">[A-x][B-2x]</span></span></div>

<h4>Sample Problem on Chemical Equilibrium</h4>
<p>Calcium carbonate decomposes at high temperatures to give calcium oxide and carbon dioxide.</p>

<p>K<sub>p</sub> for this reaction is 1.16 at 800°C. A 5.00 L vessel containing 10 grams of CaCO<sub>3(s)</sub> was evacuated to remove the
air sealed, and then heated to 800°C. Ignoring the volume occupied by the solid, what will be the mass of the solids in the vessel once equilibrium
is reached?</p>

		<p>To solve for the masses of the solids (the sum of the masses of CaCO<sub>3</sub> and mass of CaO), you need to identify first the moles of

	<li>Change in Pressure and Volume</li>
	<p>This criteria is only applicable for reactions at gaseous phase. The greater the pressure, the smaller its volume which means that both
	pressure and volume are inversely proportional (based on Boyle's law).</p>

	<p>This is the only factor that can changes the numerical value of the equilibrium constant. A temperature increase favors an endothermic reaction(&#916H=<strong>+</strong>)
	while a temperature decrease favors an exothermic reaction(&#916H=<strong>&#8722</strong>).</p>
