 <h3><a name="name">Lewis Structure</a></h3>
 <p>A very effective way to illustrate valence electrons in an element or a compound is through the illustration of
 <strong>Lewis structure</strong>. It is a simplified representation of the element wherein valence electrons are
represented by dots and bonds are represented by a line. It also exhibits how bonding of molecules should follow the octet
rule. <strong>Octet rule</strong> is the ability of atoms to achieve eight electrons in  total as part of their valence shells
which signifies their stability. Elements that already followed this rule are noble gases (group VIII in the periodic table).
However, there are some molecules that have exceptions in octet rule which is to be discussed also in this section. Let's take as
an example the drawing of Lewis structure of N<sub>2</sub> molecule.</p>
<ul>
<li>The total number of valence electron on one nitrogen atom is 5 e<sup>&#8722;</sup>. Since there are two atoms, we have
10 e<sup>&#8722;</sup> available.</li>
<div class="centerme"><img src="./imginorg/lewis1.JPG"/></div>
<li>Connecting two dots to represent a covalent bond (shows that two valence electrons share each other)</li>
<div class="centerme"><img src="./imginorg/lewis2.JPG"/></div>
<li>With that single bond formed, it still doesn't follow the octet rule by which each atom should have eight valence electrons,
we need to add more bonds until it meets the octet rule.</li>
<div class="centerme"><img src="./imginorg/lewis3.JPG"/></div>
<li>Addition of two more bonds that makes N<sub>2</sub> a triple bond shows that each atom follows the octet rule. Counting the
valence electrons (1 bond = 2 valence electrons that are shared to each other), the total number of valence electron is still 10 e<sup>&#8722;</sup>.
Thus, the appropriate Lewis structure for N<sub>2</sub> is the one with triple bond.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the molecule exhibits ionic bonding, the Lewis structure is simply the ions separated with brackets and the charges are indicated.
For example, we have MgBr<sub>2</sub>:</p>
<div class="centerme"><img src="./imginorg/lewisionic.JPG" height="150"/></div>
</div>
<div id="content2">
<div class="dark">
<h4>How to Draw a Lewis Structure of Molecules</h4>
<ol>
<li>Determine the elements present in the molecule and valence electrons of each. Take the sum of it.</li>
<li>Place the each elements together wherein the central atom is at the center. The central atom is
the one that can form the greatest number of bonds with respect to their valence electrons.</li>
<li>You can now add the electrons represented by dots in pairs surrounding the atoms. A line represents
a covalent bond between the atoms. Follow the octet rule as much as possible.</li>
<li>If there are remaining elecrons, it signifies that there is a formal charge. It should be indicated
in the Lewis structure at the upper right side of the molecule with brackets enclosed the structure. </li>
</ol>

	</div>
	<h3><a name="formal">Fomal Charges</a></h3>
 <p>Through the Lewis structure, you can determine how many valence electrons are present for a compound to be formed. Additionally,
 constructing a Lewis structure is more appropriate when you know the formal charge of an atom in the molecule.<strong>Formal charge</strong> is the charge of an atom in a
molecule or a polyatomic ion when all of the bonding electrons that were shared equally. To determine the formal charge, </p>
<div class="equation">Formal Charge of an Atom =   Number of Valence e<sup>&#8722;</sup> &#8722; e<sup>&#8722;</sup> Surrounding the Atom</div>
<p>such that</p><div class="frac"><div class="maineq"> e<sup>&#8722;</sup> Surrounding the Atom =  Lone Pair e<sup>&#8722;</sup> + </div><span class="Fraction"><span class="Numerator">Bonding e<sup>&#8722;</sup></span>
<span class="Denominator">2</span></span></div>
<p>As you can observe from the formula for electrons surrounding the atom, bonding e<sup>&#8722;</sup> is divided by two because in
	calculating formal charges, we only consider the electrons WITHIN the atom itself and disregard the shared electron from bonding.
	For example, identify the formal charges of C and O in CO<sub>3</sub>. Lewis structure for C in CO<sub>3</sub> is:</p>
<div class="centerme"><img src="./imginorg/CO3.JPG"/ height="180"></div>
<p>Analyzing carbon atom in CO<sub>3</sub>, we know that the valence electron of carbon is 4 (you can also easily identify it by refering to the
	group number of the carbon in the periodic table of elements), the number of lone pairs in this molecule is 0, and the bonding electrons is composed of
8 (single bond has two electrons each).Now, following the formula for the formal charge,</p>
<div class="frac"><div class="maineq"> Formal Charge of C =  4 &#8722; ( 0 + </div><span class="Fraction"><span class="Numerator">8</span>
<span class="Denominator">2</span></span>) = &nbsp; <strong>0</strong></div>
<p>The carbon atom in CO<sub>3</sub> is zero which indicates that it is a neutral atom. Meanwhile for the single bonded oxygen atoms in the structure. Identifying the formal charges,
valence electron of O is 6, lone pair electrons are 6, and the bonding electrons is 2 in each oxygen atom. Calculating the oxygen formal charge,</p>
<div class="frac"><div class="maineq"> Formal Charge of O =  6 &#8722; ( 6 + </div><span class="Fraction"><span class="Numerator">2</span>
<span class="Denominator">2</span></span>) = &nbsp; <strong>&#8722; 1</strong></div>
<p>It shows that the oxygen atom with a single bond on the Lewis structure indicates a charge of &#8722; 1. The overall charge of the molecule is
&#8722;1 + &#8722;1 = <strong>&#8722;2</strong>(since it has two single bonded oxygen atom). The more appropriate Lewis structure of CO<sub>3</sub> should be represented as:</p>
<div class="centerme"><img src="./imginorg/CO3final.JPG" height="180"/></div>
<p>In some cases, there are multiple Lewis structures that can represent a single compound. These similar structures are called
<strong>resonance structures</strong> by which all of them are acceptable structures. In some cases, one of the  structures is to be cosidered
most electronegative. The shifting of the structure in different forms is due to the delocalized electron which can affect the
formal charges of each of the atom. An example of a compound with resonance structure is CON, the structure on the right is more
electronegative than the structure on the left side.</p>
<div class="centerme"><img src="./imginorg/resonance.JPG"/></div>
<h3><a name="deviate">Deviations in Octet Rule</a></h3>
<p>Octet rule is most applicable on elements with atomic number below 20 by which they comply their stability by achieving eight valence electrons
to give the same electronic configurations as of the noble gases. However, there are cases some elements that doesn't require the octet rule
when forming stable bonds with another atom.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Reduced Octet Rule</strong></li>
<p>This case happens when there are too few valence electrons involved to complete the total of eight valence electron in an atom. It is common
with the bonding of elements such as boron, aluminum, and beryllium. For example, we have borane (BH<sub>3</sub>) and Beryllium chloride (BeCl<sub>2</sub>).</p>
<div class="centerme"><img src="./imginorg/reducedoctet.JPG" height="150"/></div>

<li><strong>Odd Number of Electrons Compounds</strong></li>
<p>This exception is for cases when the total number of valence electrons of a molecule is equal to an odd number. Valence electrons
usually come in pairs with regards to its sharing to the other atom and its polarity (represented by lone pairs of electrons).
However, there are highly reactive chemical species called <strong>free radicals</strong> that are formed from the odd number of total valence
electrons. The reason for them to be highly reactive they want to take an electron to another molecule in order for them to become stable. It is very
rare to find radicals that are stable enough just like nitric oxide (NO) which has odd number of valence electrons (11 in total). To indicate unstable radicals, you can put "<strong>&middot;</strong>" symbol
beside on the chemical formula. For example, hydroxyl radical is represented by &middot;OH. The Lewis structures below are the resonance structures of
nitric oxide which has an odd number of valence electrons and a radical.</p>
<div class="centerme"><img src="./imginorg/nitricoxide.JPG" height="150"/></div>
<li><strong>Expanded Octet Rule</strong></li>
<p>Other than the case of too few valence electrons, there is also a situation wherein valence electrons are too many that exceeds the
eight electrons to follow octet rule. This is usually happening with molecules with highly electronegative terminal atoms (atoms that surrounds
the central atom). Examples of molecules under the expanded octet rule are phosphorus pentachloride, PCl<sub>5</sub> (total valence electron of 40 e<sup>&#8722;</sup>)
and xenon tetrafluoride, XeF<sub>4</sub> (total valence electron of 36 e<sup>&#8722;</sup>). The reason for this event is that there is an empty d orbitals
(in the third period elements like P) for them to allow excess electrons to occupy thus making chemical bonds. Lewis structures of the examples
are as follows:</p>
<div class="centerme"><img src="./imginorg/expandedoctet.JPG" height="170"/></div>
</ol>
<h3><a name="#bonds">Bonding Theories</a></h3>
<p>Seeking for the full understanding of chemical bonding, there are several theories that were derived to demonstrate
how valence electrons behave as it undergoes chemical bonding. These theories are acceptable in different situations
that further reveals the identity and nature of some molecules. </p>
<h4><a name="vb">Valence Bond Theory</a></h4>
<p>This bonding theory states that only valence orbitals participate in the formation of a bond.
The process of forming this bonds is called <strong>hybridization</strong> by which interaction of the valence
electrons of participating atoms in the bonding forms a hybrid atomic orbital. For example, we have the bonding
between carbon atoms in single bond (C-C bond) which forms a sp<sup>3</sup> hybridized orbital.</p>
<div class="centerme"><img src="./imginorg/carbonhybrid.JPG"></div>
<p>This diagram shows that the valence electrons of carbon forms a hybrid orbital indicated by
2s,2p<sub>x</sub>,2p<sub>y</sub>, and 2p<sub>z</sub> which is an example of sp<sup>3</sup> orbital. They are distribute eqaully
to form a single bond. Other hybrids that can be formed are sp<sup>2</sup> (example is from carbon-carbon double bond), sp(
example is from carbon-carbon from triple bond), sp<sup>3</sup>d and sp<sup>3</sup>d<sup>2</sup> (formed from expanded octet rule). </p>
</section>
<div id="content3">
<h4><a name="vsepr">VSEPR Theory</a></h4>
<p>VSEPR which stands for "Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion" Theory is a bonding theory that focuses
on predicting the shape or geometry of the molecule with assuming that the valence electrons are responsible
for their framework. Geometries can be classified into two groups which are electronic geometry (in terms of
arrangement of electron groups) and molecular geometry (in terms of arrangement of atoms in three-dimensional space).
These two geometries follow the repulsion strength according to VSEPR theory that states that Bonding Pair &#8722; Lone Pair
is less than Lone Pair &#8722; Lone Pair relationship. Table of geometries are shown below.</p>

<h4><a name="mo">Molecular Orbital Theory</a></h4>
<p>The last bonding theory to be discussed is the molecular orbital theory. It demonstrates the mixing of atomic
orbitals with the concept of the orbital as a wavefunction. Bonding orbitals are the constructive interferences while
antibonding-orbitals represent the destructive interferences of a wave. To illustrate molecular orbital diagrams,
it is a linear combination of atomic orbitals. Molecular orbital diagram
is the most effective way to show properties such as bond orders,paramagnetism, or diagmagnetic property of
a molecule. Consider the molecular orbital diagram of H<sub>2</sub> molecule:</p>
<div class="centerme"><img src="./imginorg/MOtheory.JPG" height="180"/></div>

<p>As you can observe in illustrating molecular orbital diagram, atomic orbital on the sides is for the individual H atom
while at the center are the  mixed orbitals (bonding orbitals at the bottom and anti-bonding orbitals at the top). Filling up
of the electrons still follows the fundamuntal rules such as Aufbau principle, Pauli exclusion, and Hund's rule. Lower energy levels
are the bonding orbitals (&#963;) and anti-bonding orbitals (&#963;*) represents a higher energy level. With this separation, you can
now determine the property called <strong>bond order</strong>. It is a form of measurement that identifies the number of electrons
involved in a bond between two atoms in a molecule. It is a good indicator for bond stability by evaluating the molecular orbital diagram.
The formula for finding bond order with M.O. theory is:</p>
<div class="frac"><div class="maineq"> Bond Order =  </div><span class="Fraction"><span class="Numerator">1</span>
<span class="Denominator">2</span></span>( Total e<sup>&#8722;</sup> &nbsp at &#963; orbital &#8722; Total e<sup>&#8722;</sup> &nbsp at &#963;* orbital)</div>
<p>Another property that can be identified in M.O. theory is paramagnetism or diamagnetism of a molecule. As discussed on the lesson
on electronic configurations, diamagnetism is exhibited on paired electrons while paramagnetism is on unpaired electrons. As the valence
electrons on the molecular orbital diagram is shown, you can determine if the molecule is paramagnetic or diamagnetic. </p>
<h4>Guidelines or Patterns in Making M.O. Diagram with Homogeneous Atoms </h4>
<p>Since similar atoms have same energy levels and electronegativity they exhibit molecular orbital diagrams wit some patterns when they
bond to each other (at the valence p-orbital). For less electronegative elements such as boron (B), carbon (C), and nitrogen (N), they have a M.O. diagram pattern
shown:</p>
<div class="centerme"><img src="./imginorg/MOpattern1.JPG" height="250"/></div>
<p>For more electronegative elements such as Oxygen (O), Fluorine (F), and Neon (Ne), their pattern in M.O. diagram is:</p>
<div class="centerme"><img src="./imginorg/MOpattern2.JPG" height="300" width="800"/></div>

<p>Applying the concepts of molecular orbital theory, identify the  M.O. diagram for O<sub>2</sub> molecule, its bond order, and if it is
paramagnetic or diamagnetic. </p>
