	<h3>General Chemistry</h3>
	<p class="parjustify">General Chemistry Course includes fundamental topics in Chemistry
	in order to prepare into the other fields of higher chemistry. It includes states and properties of matter,
fundamental chemical observations, chemical formula and chemical equations, mass and moles
relationships, and chemical equilibria.</p>

		<h3>Inorganic Chemistry</h3>
		<p class="parjustify">Inorganic Chemistry Course is an advanced study on some topics input
		general chemistry to further understand the nature of chemical interactions especially on each of the
	elements in the periodic table. Some topic includes periodic trends, effective nuclear charges, quantum numbers, nuclear
	chemistry, symmetries, solid and liquid state chemistry, and crystal field theory.</p>

		<h3>Analytical Chemistry</h3>
		<p class="parjustify">Analytical Chemistry Course is for the science of obtaining, processing, and quantifying
			a certain composition of matter. This section focuses on the classical and instrumental methods of analysis. To better understand some topics, basic knowledge on statistics ins
			applied. Topics in analytical chemistry focuses on gravimetric methods, titrimetric methods, and instrumentations.

			<h3>Number of human bones is greater on babies than the adults</h3>
			<p>The bones in the human skeleton fuses together as the human grows. Initially, a baby
			has about 270 bones by which most of it are cartilages while adults decreases
		its number of bones up to 206 bones. The smallest bone is the stapes found in the middle air while
	femur (thighbone) is the largest among the bones. </p>

	<h3>Planet Earth is a giant magnet</h3>
	<p>In studying Earth science, the inner core (part of the layer of the Earth) is composed	of solid iron surrounded
	by molten liquid iron. At this state, temperature and density varies resulting to create currents in the iron. As the
Earth rotates, those currents combine with each other to form a large magnetic field. Today, we apply this principle with the
use of compasses in locating places. Its needle responses to the magnetic field involved in the core.</p>

	<h3>The human stomach acid is strong enough to dissolve a stainless steel</h3>
	<p>As we digests food, our stomach produces a highly corrosive acid (known as peptic acid in biochemistry or hydrochloric acid
		in chemistry) with a pH scale from 2 to 3. This acid can also attack your stomach linings which is the cause of hyperacidity disorder.
	Through the buffering effect of bicarbonate solution produced, your stomach linings were protected from the corrosive acid.</p>
